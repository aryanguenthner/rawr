    RAWR is designed to make the process of web enumeration easy and efficient by
     providing pertinent information in usable formats.  It uses NMap(live or from
     file), Metasploit, Qualys, Nexpose, or Nessus scan data to target web services
     for enumeration, then visits each host on each port with an identified web
     service and gathers as much data as possible.
