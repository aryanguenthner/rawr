RAWR_META is designed to do a recursive search for files in a folder, pulling as much information as possible from
each file's properties, content, and metadata. It creates an HTML report of each file and any findings.  It can be
run in conjunction with a RAWR scan using --meta, or as a standalone process by running the script directly and
specifying a file/files/glob-format string.
